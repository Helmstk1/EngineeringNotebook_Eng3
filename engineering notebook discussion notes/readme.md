# Engineering notebooks and Journals

This engineering notebook is 28% of their grade?  Too much!  To fix this, weekly submissions of the notebook, PLUS a big "end of module" engingeering notebook submission
This submission will be valued equal to the weekly submissions, they are 50/50.

Each week's submissions will be a URL submitted (encourage #heading based URLS, use tables?).
THEN the students will write a submission comment about what they accomplished this week.

When the students move to projects, this idea will continue in the form of a journal.  Every week, they will still submit their engineering notebook for the project, but they will
also submit their journal (or copy the journal entry and paste it into submission comments?)  The will not be graded on the content of their journal, its to show what they've done
without sullying up their nice engineering notebook readme.md

If the kids are going to be submitting their notebook weekly, the assignment page does not to be davinci.  Keep it lite and clean, so we can focus on specific topics, like image size,
formatting, etc.
